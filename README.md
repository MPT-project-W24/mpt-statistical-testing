# Track_o_Nauts
Hello! Welcome to our software engineering project Track-o-Nauts. Within this repository we have created software for visualization and statisical testing to improve multiple particle tracking data quality and experimental design.

### Dependencies
The Track-o-Nauts Python Packages run in Python environments, and require Pandas, Numpy, SciPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. These packages were developed using up-to-date versions of Python=3.11, Pandas, Numpy=1.23.3, SciPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib as of March 13, 2024.

### Packages
* meng's .py files
* khanh's .py file
* TrackONautsVis.py file - contains functions to plot features of the video of interest. Functions include particle position plot, pairwise plot for all features, pairwise plot for two specified features, and violin plot of a specified feature distribution.
* TrackONautsStats.py - contains functions to rapidly run statistical methods on dataframes. V1.0 contains Pearson pairwise correlation, descriptive statistics, and outlier identification

### How to use
Functions from the .py files can be imported and utilized in Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts. Example use cases are available in the 'Notebooks' directory.
